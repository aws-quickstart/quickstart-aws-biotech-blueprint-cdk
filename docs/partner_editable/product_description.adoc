This Quick Start builds an informatics infrastructure on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It sets up a virtual data center with partitioned virtual private clouds (VPCs) for biotech development, production, and management processes. You can also use the Quick Start to launch the industryâ€™s leading scientific research applications from the AWS Service Catalog into this infrastructure.  

You have the choice of deploying the Quick Start from an AWS CloudFormation template or using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). For more information on what this Quick Start deploys, see link:#_architecture[Architecture], later in this guide.
