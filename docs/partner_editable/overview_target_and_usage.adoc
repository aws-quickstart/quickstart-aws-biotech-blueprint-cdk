This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides instructions for deploying {{partner-produc-name}} on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start automatically builds a biotech research infrastructure on the AWS Cloud based on AWS best practices. It prepares a foundation environment configured with identity management, access control, encryption key management, network configuration, logging, alarms, partitioned environments, and built-in compliance auditing. Into this core you can deploy informatics and computational add-on products such as the following:

* https://chemaxon.com/products/compound-registration[ChemAxon Compound Registration]
* https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/biotech-blueprint/nextflow/[Nextflow]
* https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/biotech-blueprint/dotmatics-suite/[Dotmatics Suite]
* https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/hail/[Hail 0.2]
* https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/biotech-blueprint/titian-mosaic-freezermanagement/[Titian Mosaic FreezerManagement]

For more information on what this Quick Start deploys, see link:#_architecture[Architecture], later in this guide.

You build the {{partner-product-name}} foundation by deploying the Quick Start master template. You can choose to deploy this in an AWS CloudFormation template or using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). For more information, see link:#_deployment_steps[Deployment Steps], later in this guide. After deploying the master template, you can install your choice of AWS Partner informatics tools. They are available by default in the AWS Service Catalog console. For more information about post-deployment steps, see link:#_additional_information[Additional Information], later in this guide.
