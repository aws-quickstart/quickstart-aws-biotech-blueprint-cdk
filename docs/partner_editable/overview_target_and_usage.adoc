This Quick Start automatically builds a biotech research infrastructure on the AWS Cloud based on AWS best practices. It prepares a base environment configured for identity management, access control, encryption key management, network configuration, logging, alarms, partitioned environments, and built-in compliance auditing. Into this core you can deploy informatics and computational add-on products using AWS Service Catalog, such as:
