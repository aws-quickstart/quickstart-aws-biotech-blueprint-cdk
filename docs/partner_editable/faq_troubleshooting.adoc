== FAQ

*Q.* What VPCs and subnets should I deploy resources into?

*A.* The Quick Start builds an architecture with three VPCs: production, development, and management. Each is equipped with public, private, and - in the production and development VPCs - isolated subnets. Consider the function of the resource when choosing the VPC. For example, use the management VPC for operational resources such as DevOps tools, active directories, and security appliances. The Biotech Blueprint Quick Start deploys client VPN endpoints into the public subnets of the management VPC.

Consider the level of isolation the resource requires when choosing the subnet. Reserve public subnets for internet-facing resources such as load balancers. Use private subnets for resources that should not be internet-facing but require outbound internet access. Deploy sensitive resources such as databases addressable only by internal networks to isolated subnets which do not route traffic to the internet. For more information about public and private subnets, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html[VPC with public and private subnets (NAT)].

The following table provides some examples.

|DevOps tool to automate deployments to production and development VPCs |Management |Private

*Q.* Why are there two subnets of the same class in each VPC? 

*A.* Each subnet of the same class is in a different Availability Zone, providing high availability. Subnets of the same class are identical from a networking perspective, so it does not matter which you specify when deploying a resource.

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure that you delete the stack after troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].
