=== AWS CDK deployment

To deploy {partner-product-name} using the AWS CDK, do the following:
[start=1]
. Verify that you have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites[prerequisites^] to install the AWS CDK. 

. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install[Install the AWS CDK^].

. Clone the {partner-product-name} Quick Start repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-startup-blueprint.git
```
[start=4]
. Build the project.
```bash
npm run build 
```

[start=5]
. Bootstrap your AWS environment.
```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

NOTE: You can review and change code. For example, you can use different VPC CIDR ranges (`aws-vpcs.ts`) or a different internal DNS apex (`aws-dns.ts` defaults to `corp`). 

[start=6]
. Deploy.

```bash 
npm run build && cdk deploy
```

TIP: To update the architecture after making changes later, run the command in Step 6.

== Post deployment steps
// If Post-deployment steps are required, add them here. If not, remove the heading

=== Connect to the VPN

The Quick Start deploys a client VPN endpoint in the management VPC that will route traffic over peering connections to the production and development VPCs. The management VPC is the hub for networking into the other VPCs. The production and development VPCs are designed not to be able to communicate with each other directly. After deploying the Quick Start, follow these instructions to connect to the VPN.

[start=1]
. Navigate to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#ClientVPNEndpoints:sort=clientVpnEndpointId[Client VPN Endpoint section in the AWS VPC web console^].
. Select the client VPN endpoint listed,
. Select *Download Client Configuration*. Your browser downloads a `downloaded-client-config.ovpn` file.
+
:xrefstyle: short
[#downloadclientconfig]
.Download Client Configuration
image::../images/downloadclientconfig.png[VPN,width=100%,height=100%]

[start=4]
. Navigate to the AWS S3 console.
. Open the bucket with the prefix `awsstartupblueprintstack-clientvpnvpnconfigbucket*`.
. Download the `client1.domain.tld.key` and `client1.domain.tld.crt`. 
+
NOTE: The other three files are the CA chain and server key/cert. You will need those to create additional client certificates.

[start=5]
. Open `downloaded-client-config.ovpn` in a text editor.
. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file. Replace the contents of the two files inside the respective `<cert>` and `<key>` sections.

```
<cert>
Contents of client certificate file (client1.domain.tld.crt)
</cert>

<key>
Contents of private key file (client1.domain.tld.key)
</key>
```

[start=7]
. Save and close the file. You can establish a VPN connection with the configuration and an OpenVPN client or AWS provided client.

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/connect-aws-client-vpn-connect.html[Connect using an AWS provided client^]

With a VPN connection, you can connect to resources you launch into your VPCs using private IP addresses. For more information about deploying resources, see link:#_deploying_resources_into_VPCs[Deploying resources into VPCs], later in this guide.

== Deploying resources into VPCs

This Quick Start builds an architecture with three VPCs: production, development, and management. Use the management VPC for operational resources such as DevOps tools, Active Directories, and security appliances. For example, the Biotech Blueprint Quick Start deploys Client VPN endpoints into the public subnets of the management VPC. Production and development VPCs are provided so you can manage live and test environments with different levels of controls.  

Reserve public subnets for internet-facing resources such as load balancers. Use private subnets for resources that should not be internet-facing but require outbound internet access. Deploy sensitive resources such as databases addressable only by internal networks to isolated subnets which do not route traffic to the internet. For more information about public and private subnets, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html[VPC with public and private subnets (NAT)^].

The following table provides some examples. 

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Resource |VPC |Subnet

|Test server |Development |Private
|Amazon Relational Database Server (Amazon RDS) snapshot restored from development VPC |Production |Isolated
|Application Load Balancer to test a custom TLS certificate |Development |Public
|DevOps tool to automate deployments to production and development VPCs |Management |Private
|Okta Cloud Connect appliance |Management VPC |Private

== Biotech Blueprint Informatics Catalog

After deploying the Quick Start, you can launch the following informatics and scientific applications from the https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/home?isSceuc=true&region=us-east-1#/products[AWS Service Catalog console^]:

=== AWS Service Catalog permissions
Access to AWS Service Catalog requires credentials. Those credentials must have permission to access AWS resources, such as an AWS Service Catalog portfolio or product. AWS Service Catalog integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enable you to grant AWS Service Catalog end users permissions to launch products and manage provisioned products. To control access, you attach these policies to the IAM users, groups, and roles that you use with AWS Service Catalog.

[start=1]
. Navigate to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/home?#portfolios?activeTab=localAdminPortfolios[AWS Service Catalog console^]. 
. Select the *Biotech Blueprint Informatics Catalog* portfolio.
. Select the *Groups, roles, and users* tab.

[start=4]
. Select *Add groups, users, and roles*.
. Select the IAM identities requiring AWS Service Catalog permissions. Do not forget to include yourself if you need permissions.

== Optional DNS setup
The Quick Start sets up a private DNS with `.corp` as the apex domain using https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/home#Dashboard[Amazon Route 53 in your account^]. Using the Amazon Route 53 console, you can create `A` or `CNAME` records to private applications you deploy.
